//Inside the <Home> component, there are a couple of variables defined that will allow you to insert your name and city into the portfolio page.

//The <Home> component should return the following JSX elements:

//a <div> element with an id of "home"
//inside the div element, there should be one child element:
//a <h1> element, with the style attribute set to a color of "firebrick", and the content of "Your Name is a Web Developer from Your City"
//use the imported name and city variables within the component, and the JSX expression syntax to use the variables inside your JSX elements
